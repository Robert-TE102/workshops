          A logo is a graphic mark, emblem, or symbol used to aid and promote
          public identification and recognition. It may be of an abstract or
          figurative design or include the text of the name that it represents,
          as in a wordmark.

          In the days of hot metal typesetting, a logotype was one word cast as
          a single piece of type (e.g. "The" in ATF Garamond), as opposed to a
          ligature, which is two or more letters joined, but not forming a word.
          By extension, the term was also used for a uniquely set and arranged
          typeface or colophon. At the level of mass communication and in common
          usage, a company's logo is today often synonymous with its trademark
          or brand.
